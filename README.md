# Read me Please :)

## The way to import the project:
- File -> Open Projects from File System -> Directory -> "Select the project directory"

## When you want to program some functionality for a trello task, it is better to do it in another branch!
- Create and switch to another branch: git checkout -b "task-userlogin"

## When you want to upload the changes on Github:
- git add .
- git commit -m "your message"
- git push

## When you want to merge your branch (when you finish) with the master branch
- Create pull request on Github

Any questions you can ask David, he is bored all day!
